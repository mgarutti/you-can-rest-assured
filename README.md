# You can Rest Assured!

This is an ongoing repository for my API testing playground using Java and RestAssured.

For now, it is just bare-bones, but I plan to keep it updated with more examples and also add GitHub Actions integration as well.

## Installation

This project uses Maven, Java and a lot of patience - required to do the initial setup on a Windows machine.
```bash
Do not worry, this documentation will be updated with the proper instructions to set up the project. Soon.
```
